# Mobile Hub Demo App

The App demonstrates the backend configured through Mobile Hub. 

## Requirements

* Xcode 8 and later 
* iOS 9 and later

## Using the Sample


### Installing Cocoapods

The demo app uses the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS, which is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). If you have not installed CocoaPods, install CocoaPods:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Install dependencies

After installing `Cocoapods`, go inside the `MySampleApp` folder which contains the `Podfile` and run the following command:

```
pod install --repo-update
```

### Build and Run

Next, open the `MySampleApp.xcworkspace` file generated by Cocoapods and run the Demo app. Do NOT open the `.xcodeproj` file since it does not have the dependencies required for the app.

To Run the app, click on icon which looks like `play` button on top left corner of Xcode IDE, alternatively, you can use `Cmd + R` to run the app.
